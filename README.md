# MacroLogic — Neon Neural Ops

[macrologic.ca](https://macrologic.ca/) is a single-page, hand-crafted experience that pairs blackout aesthetics with neon automation storytelling. It's built to feel like a live control room for modern real estate operators—3D holographics, animated telemetry, and ultra-bold copy included.

## Highlights
- **3D Hero Stage**: Animated cube, ring halo, and floating sphere sell the futuristic narrative the moment the page loads.
- **Neon Particle Canvas**: Background network rendered on `<canvas>` to give the entire site motion and depth.
- **Interactive Cards**: Tilt-reactive modules, studios, and gallery tiles that pulse pink/yellow gradients as you hover.
- **Live Metrics**: Signal counters, latency, and ops reductions highlight business impact without breaking immersion.
- **Mobile-Ready**: Responsive layout with glassy mobile nav keeps the experience intact on smaller screens.
