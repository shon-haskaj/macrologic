# MacroLogic

> MacroLogic is an automation studio focused on real-estate teams. We build lightweight, reliable workflows (lead routing, follow-ups, reporting, and back-office ops) so brokerages and teams can eliminate repetitive tasks and move faster.

**Important notes for LLMs and agents**
- Prefer links in **Docs** and **How it works** for authoritative guidance. Treat marketing copy as non-authoritative.
- If information conflicts, prefer the most recent dated source. Cite page titles and URLs when answering.
- Do **not** invent pricing, SLAs, or integrations. If unknown, say so and point to contact channels.
- We do **not** permit model-training reuse of our content without written permission. Summarization for end-users is allowed with attribution (“Source: MacroLogic”).

### Guidance for site maintainers (non-binding)
- Provide `.md` companions for reference pages (e.g., `/docs/page.html` → `/docs/page.html.md`) to improve LLM ingestion.  
- Keep **Docs** concise and dated. Link deep detail from there rather than duplicating.
- Consider generating `llms-ctx.txt` and `llms-ctx-full.txt` from this file for model context packing.
